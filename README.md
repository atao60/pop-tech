Pop Tech
========

A blog with static pages generated by [jbake](http://jbake.org) and hosted by [Github](https://github.com/).

The howto is inspired by the blog of [Y. Bonnel blog](http://www.ybonnel.fr/), hosted [here](https://github.com/ybonnel/blog).


Changes
----

* Doesn't use [Github Site Plugin](http://github.com/github/maven-plugins) but [maven-scm-publish-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/).
* Generate excerpts for the index and feed pages. 
* Share parameters between maven and jbake-maven-plugin.
* Libraries for css and js can be upgraded with maven.
* Misc. (tag counters, escaped rss titles, ...)



Display
----

To see the blog, go to the blog [on Github](http://atao60.github.io/pop-tech) or [on popsuite](http://www.popsuite.net).

Edit
-----

The posts can be written with any of these formats: Markdown, AsciiDoc and HTML.

Run
------

* To update the frameworks (bootstrap, prettify, ...):

>      mvn clean initialize -Dsetup-assets   
      
* To install the Java classes in the local m2 repository (see roadmap below):

>      mvn install        

* To preview the changes:

>      mvn clean initialize jbake:inline

>    and go to [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)  
(the port is defined by "jbake.port" in the pom file).
      
* Before publishing, save the changes on Github.   

* To publish the changes:
	  
>      mvn clean jbake:generate scm-publish:publish-scm
	  
Roadmap
------

* The pom is quite messy as it needs to deal with installing the java classes defined for this blog. They have to be installed in the local m2 repository to be used with jbake-maven-plugin. At the moment, *mvn install* launches jbake:inline (oups!). 

* SyntaxHighlight doesn't work as expected. Either find out the right configuration, or replace it.
